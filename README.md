# alternatives.fish 

`alternatives` is a regex/awk/sed _hellspawn_ I created some time ago to 
provide a better interface to `update-alternatives` for less verbose commandline usage

In order to use it, either install `omf` and clone this rep in to your package directory, or
place the `alternatives` script in your path.

This requires a few things:

    - my fish require framework
    - realpath
    - gawk / awk / sed / grep
